Go to downloads and find the printer and select to download the linux (deb) version.

Download the Driver Install Tool.

After the download you should get the download instructions.

On step 4... don't use 'sudo su'.  Instead just use 'sudo' on step 5.

Also on step 5, for 'Brother machine name' use 'MFC-7840W'.

On step 6 where it asks you to choose DeviceURI, say yes.  After that it asks you to choose the device.  You will see a list of options.  You should use the option to input the IP address.  The IP address usually used for the printer is 192.168.1.42

After this it will send out a test print... you should be done.
