# Moneydance Archive and Restore


## Create backup/archive

In Moneydance, go to **File > Export Backup...**

Save the **.moneydancearchive** file.

Make sure this gets backed up somewhere at some point.


## Restore Moneydance from monedancearchive file

First, copy the **_somename_.moneydancearchive** file into the **~/.moneydance/Documents/** folder (don't go into the backup folder).

Open MoneyDance. You should get the **Welcome to Moneydance** startup screen. Select **Import new account set**. (If you don't get the **Welcome to Moneydance** startup screen, go to **File > Restore from Backup...**)

Navigate to the **_somename_.moneydancearchive** file you placed into the **~/.moneydance/Documents/** folder and click **Open**. (You may need to use **ctrl+h** to view hidden folders and files.)

You should now be good to go.
